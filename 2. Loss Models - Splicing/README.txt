In this subproject, a body and tail splicing approach for modeling the loss severities of insurance claims is investigated. The goal of this approach is to take extreme tail events into account explicitly by combining separate data generating processes for both the body and the tail of the loss distribution. As a practical consideration, the resulting models can assist an insurance company in the pricing of an unlimited excess-loss layer above an operational priority.

In the first part of the demo "Loss Models - Splicing.R", the properties of a loss distribution are investigated and an attempt is made to model the corresponding data sample by using a single data generating process. In this context, an overview of the data characteristics is generated and exponential and lognormal models are subsequently calibrated to the data sample. Next, an analysis on the goodness of fit of the respective models reveals that a single data generating process insuciently captures the complete loss distribution spectrum. More precisely, the extreme losses in the tails are not captured adequately by these simple models.
The second part of the demo illustrates how splicing can overcome the latter problem. Two distinct spliced 'body-tail' distributions are calibrated to the loss data and the resulting models are compared.

The paper "Loss Models - Splicing.R" provides additional details and background information on the underlying theoretical concepts.
